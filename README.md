## Installation

Installation is performed using `npm i` from the root folder.

## Testing

To run tests, first build and seed using the commands `npm run build` and `npm run seed`. Once this is done, Cypress can be launched using the `npx cypress open` command to load the testing window. Both component and e2e (end-to-end) testing is configured and can be run.
